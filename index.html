            <p>Community-based organization (CBO) activities are often not sufficiently acknowledged and publicized in
                humanitarian response, and the COVID-19 pandemic response is, regrettably, following the same trend. The
                objective of this report is to outline the various contributions of CBO activities in terms to COVID-19
                response, with a special emphasis on the case studies of Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Nigeria and Syria
                through a process of data scoping, as part of iMMAP's COVID-19 Situation Analysis Project.</p><br />
